TASK 1: Steganography Basics

1. Create a .txt file with a secrete message of your choosing. Place the .txt file and the
stegimage.png from the repository alone in a directory.
2. Zip the .txt in a text.zip file. If you do not have archiving software, download something
like 7-zip or WinRAR.
3. Open your command line and cd into the relevant directory. Once there, type dir to view
the contents of the directory.
4. Enter “copy /b stegimage.png+text.zip image2.png” into the console.
5. When opening this new image, there should be no differences. Great!
6. Now try opening this image with an archiving software, and you should see the original
stegimage.png and text.txt files.

You’ve successfully concealed a secret message in an image file!
